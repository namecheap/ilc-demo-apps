    <h1>Hi! Welcome to our Demo website.</h1>

        Use links from the main menu to see examples of  apps written on different technologies running side by side on the
        same page stitched together by Isomorphic Layout Composer.

        This particular area was written on Vanilla JS using Lodash template while Navbar is written on React.

<% } else if (getCurrentPathProps().page === 'wrapped') { %>
    <h1>Welcome to target app that is hidden under App Wrapper.</h1>
    <p>
        You can see it now as Wrapper App immediately initiates target app rendering if it sees special query parameter.
        <br>
        This functionality works well with client side rendering and SSR (see what comes from server with & without query parameter).
    </p>
    <p>
        App Wrappers are useful if you want to extract some bootstrap, loading or authorization functionality from different apps and
        being able to control it from a single place.
    </p>
    <p>
        App Wrappers can also pass additional props to target app. See props this app received now:
        <pre><%- JSON.stringify(getCurrentPathProps(), null, 2) %></pre>
    </p>

    <h1>Unexpected error</h1>
